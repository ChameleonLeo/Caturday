# [Caturday](http://chameleon.pythonanywhere.com/)

This is just a pet-project, created to get hands-on experience of developing with Django.<br>
<b>Warning! Content isn't serious, it was made just for fun.</b><br>
And I know, my code is awful. Maybe I'll refactor it some day:) <br><br>
If you wanna see the result of my first steps as a backender, you are welcome:<br>

Caturday website consists of 3 parts. Thoth is the simpliest one, it provides you with randomly selected post.
Polls and Blogs have more functionality: forms for voting, sorting posts, pagination, creating new / editing posts, etc.
Also, website is extended with registration and authentication system.
