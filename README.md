# [Caturday](http://chameleon.pythonanywhere.com/)

Here is my first Django project Caturday.
My code is awful, I know. I'll refactor it some day:) <br><br>
If you wanna see the result of my first steps as a backender, you are welcome:<br>

Project contains 3 apps. The most wide functionality has the Blogs part.
